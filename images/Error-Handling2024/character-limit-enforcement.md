### Error Handling: Character Count Control

This image showcases the **character limit enforcement** method within the marinaDB application. When users enter text in the "Staff Use Form" notes section, the application limits input to 100 characters. If the limit is exceeded, an error message appears, notifying the user that "The note cannot exceed 100 characters." This error handling feature prevents excessive data entry, maintaining consistency and ensuring that notes are concise and manageable.
